# vs-code-configs
My custom profile collection for vs-code.


- I have disabled all of the telemetry, background update and inbuilt extension and color themes, which makes vscode to load more faster and consumes less memory and cpu.


- just import any of the profiles in vscode through profile settings.
- I will update these settings in future with more optimization.
